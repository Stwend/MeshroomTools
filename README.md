# MeshroomTools
A few useful tools for processing Meshroom scans inside Blender, loosely based on https://github.com/patmo141/object_alignment

Done so far:

- UDIM packing into a single texture
- Placing alignment marker objects
- Mirror alignment
- Alignment to other scans

This readme will be updated with detailed usage instructions once the plugin is in a largely bug free and feature complete state.
